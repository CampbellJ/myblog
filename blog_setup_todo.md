- [ ] Change the file name to include today’s date and the title of your post. 
      Jekyll requires posts to be named year-month-day-title.md
- [ ] Update the title at the top of the Markdown file. Those variables at the top of the blog post are called front matter, 
      which we’ll dig into a little later. In this case, they specify which layout to use and the title of the blog post
